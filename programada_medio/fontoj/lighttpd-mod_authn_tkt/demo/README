This README assumes that you are in the demo directory
To use Python CGI, just copy it to the web_root directory:
cp login.cgi web_root/

If you want to use the C version, build it as follows:
gcc login_cgi.c -o web_root/login.cgi -lcrypto

Execute Lighttpd with:
lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf

After that, open a browser and access http://localhost:8080/index.html
The example has a link to a protected.html page that the server will only show
if the authn_tkt cookie is present and has valid data. In this example, such
cookie is generated by http://localhost:8080/login.cgi
